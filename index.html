                    Today was the NCAA March Madness championship game! March Madness is one of my favorite tournaments every year, so I was really glad to see it successfully completed this year after last year's tournament was cancelled
                    due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I believed that Gonzaga was going to win the game and complete their undefeated season (I also picked them to win the tournament on my bracket), so I was really surprised (like many other
                    people were as well) by the <b>dominant</b> performance by Baylor. Nonetheless, Baylor was a deserving champion and I found the tournament overall to be really entertaining, which is always what I'm looking for from March
                    Madness!

                    Today I was assigned to my team for the quarter-long CSE 110 project. Although I don't know any of the other people in my group, I am still looking forward to working with them to create something cool. Plus, I think
                    it will be a great experience for me because it will allow me to learn how to successfully collaborate with a new team of people in a software engineering setting, and I can make some new friends along the way, which
                    will be refreshing for me after spending so much time in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic.

                    Today, I watched as SpaceX launched another 60 of its <i>Starlink</i> satellites into orbit. They did so using their <i>Falcon 9</i> rocket, which carried the satellites into orbit and then landed back on Earth. I still find it
                    incredible that SpaceX has been able to engineer a rocket that can launch into orbit and <em>consistently</em> stick the landing back on Earth to be reused for future missions! Watching the launch reminded me of the Crew Dragon
                    Demo-2 mission that took place last year. It was one of the most awe-inspiring moments for me in recent memory since it was the first time in almost a decade that Americans were launched into space from American soil
                    in almost a decade, and I saw an interesting animation of the mission which you can check out below.

                    And if you want to know more about that historic mission, I found an episode of a cool NASA podcast that provided even more background information about it. You can listen to it below!
